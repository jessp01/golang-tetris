# Golang Tetris

This is my first experience writing games in Golang. I stumbled upon the 2D game library at [github.com/faiface/pixel](github.com/faiface/pixel) and wanted to try it out. After using it for this game, I have to admit that the library is very well designed and easy to use. Anyone interested in creating games should definitely check it out.

This is a typical Tetris clone. I tried to make the gameplay experience as smooth as possible though the game is lacking bells and whistles like a title-screen. Here are some screen shots of the game:

## Running the Game
The only dependency that the game uses is the game library github.com/faiface/pixel. If you don't have it already you can run `go get github.com/faiface/pixel` to install it as well as `go get github.com/zkry/golang-tetris` to get the game.

Once you have the files, you can run `go run *.go` to play the game.
